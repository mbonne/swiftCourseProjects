# Swift Projects

Getting on this Swift bandwagon to have some fun.

This Repo contains my WIP files from some Swift courses I've been taking in my sparetime.

The apps will eventually go up on my website. But faster for me to push, commit changes here with git cli and desktop apps.

Let me know if you find anything useful, or have some tips for me.
