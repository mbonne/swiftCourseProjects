# Swift Projects

Getting on this Swift bandwagon to have some fun.

I'm sharing the swift code used is some of the Apps I've been making while learing to code iOS Apps.
These are not the full Xcode files, you'll need to copy and paste if you want the app to run on your phone.

The apps will eventually go up on my website. But faster for me to push, commit changes here with git cli and desktop apps.

Let me know if you find anything useful, or have some tips for me.
